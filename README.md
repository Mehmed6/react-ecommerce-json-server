# 🛒 React E-Commerce Application with JSON Server

This project is a **React-based E-Commerce Web Application** powered by a **mock backend using JSON Server**.  
It demonstrates a full front-end shopping experience with **product listing, product details, cart management, and checkout simulation**.  
The project is ideal for learning **React**, **REST API integration**, and **frontend architecture** without needing a real backend.

## 💡 Project Overview

This e-commerce project mimics a real-world shopping platform where users can:

- View product lists fetched from a fake API (`json-server`)
- View detailed product pages
- Add and remove products from their shopping cart
- Calculate cart totals dynamically
- Simulate an order placement
- Experience a responsive design layout

It is built entirely on **React** and uses **Vite** for fast development and bundling.  
A **JSON Server** provides API endpoints with mock product data stored in `db.json`.
